Here is my dueling game.

Raylib integration
Ui Contains: Combat Log, Player/Enemy Stats and a Message prompt.

Enemy: Can Attack, Parry, Defend, Heavy Attack, and Dodge. Stamina functionality works. And might be able to drop item.

Hero:  Can Attack, Parry, Defend, Heavy Attack, and Dodge. Stamina functionality works. Might be able to equip item and level up.

Bugs:
Have an old bug where the enemies health doesnt reset everytime he dies.
The Levelup function is outputting in the console. Not sure if it works.

Tweaks to be done:
Text display tweaks, combat log and user stats too close. 
Add input system for whether or not to equip item.
Check if inventory drops properly and is equipped properly. Also check if it is displayed correctly.

Upcoming changes:
Rectangle box for Combat log and Ui.
Inventory system maybe?
Animations?
